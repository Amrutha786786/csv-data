# csv-data
A collection of CSV datasets for learning and practicing Data Analysis and Machine Learning projects.

## Overview
This repository contains CSV datasets organized into two categories: **raw-data** and **processed-data**.  
They are designed to help learners and practitioners work on **Data Analysis** and **Machine Learning** projects.

## Folder Structure
- **raw-data**
  - Contains unmodified CSV files.
  - These datasets are the starting point for practice — you’ll need to perform cleaning, preprocessing, and transformations before using them in ML or data analysis projects.
  
- **processed-data**
  - Contains modified CSV files.
  - These datasets are cleaned and ready-to-use for any Machine Learning or Data Analysis workflows.
